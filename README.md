<b>Aim:</b> <br>Investigating the best algorithms for clustering and PM2.5 prediction. 
<br><br>
<b>Background:</b> <br> Recently, the air quality is getting worse and worse. With many serious air pollutions, 
people  have  become  more  aware  of  the  importance  of  air  protection.  Among  them, 
PM2.5  is  one  of  the  important  factors  that  cause  haze.  Only  when  the  content  of 
PM2.5  in  the  air  drops,  can  the  haze  situation  be  alleviated.  Therefore,  the  dataset 
used in this study is the 2017-2019 air quality data of Seoul, South Korea. The main 
purpose  of  this  study  is  to  analyze  and  predict  PM2.5  in  district  105,  so  as  to  deter-
mine the changes in PM2.5 in the next 200 days.
